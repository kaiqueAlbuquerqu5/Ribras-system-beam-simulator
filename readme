First install Grace
$	sudo apt-get install grace

To compile the program Sec_Beam: 
-> Open SecRIBRAS folder in the terminal and type
$	make clean
$	make


To run the program:
-> open bin folder an fill de in.dat file with all necessary information. If the biparametric option is "no", It is not
need to fill your informations. In the "Input" folder inside "Sec_Beam" folder you need to put the cross section of the
simulation, if you don't, the standard cross section is the 8Li.
-> In the bin folder, open the terminal and type
$	./secRIBRAS < in.dat


All the output files are in the "Output" folders their respective simulations (Sec_Beam and Biparametric).

--> 06/01/2023:
Implementation of considering a diameter for the primary beam;
Changing some aspects of the program's interface (mainly in the "bin" folder);
Printing new aspects of the program, like as the reaction points.

--> 11/01/2023:
Some corrections in plotGraf function to obey the consideration of the primary beam deameter;
Implementation of an algorithm to bar the primary beam in first collimator and in the faraday cup;
Consideration of a primary beam energies normal distribution;
New changes in program reading parameters, whit the insertion of the sigma of the primary beam energy,
the radius of the first and second collimator, the faraday cup and the lollipop.

--> 06/05/2023:
Merge tof programs secBeam and Biparametric.

--> 16/05/2023
A root macro has been written to produce the graphics of the outputs files in bipametric folder.

--> 22/05/2023
Some corrections in the plot2D function (previosly called plotGraf);
Inclusion of a frame in plot2D, like in scatter.

--> 25/05/2023
Inclusion of the contaminants in the biparametric production.

--> 29/05/2023
Corrections in the contaminants struct.

-->18/07/2023
New error messages.
Inclusion of the manual in the main folder.

-->28/07/2023
Correction made in the reaction points. In the reaction points file the program was writing in z coordinate 2.66 and not 2.64 which is the correct target position value

-->07/10/2023
Correction made to the calculation on the exit path after reaction on the secondary target.

-->30/01/2023
Changes were made in the input file, adding the charge of the ejectile in the place of the secundary thickness.
